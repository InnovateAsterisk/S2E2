# Season 2 Episode 2

In this Episode we will be installing Asterisk and The Browser Phone onto a Virtual Private Cloud. We are going to be using Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud, and we will be installing Ubuntu 18 LTS and CentOS 8. We will use Apache to host the phone pages, and reverse proxy the /ws/ folder to Asterisk. We will use Certbot to generate and maintain a certificate for us, but please be sure that you are in control of a domain, and are able to add DNS entries. Both Google and Amazon have free options, so this will not cost anything at first.
